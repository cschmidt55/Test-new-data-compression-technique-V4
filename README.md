# Test-new-data-compression-technique-V4
new version
If you don't have Matlab, you can sign up and request the free trial version for one month. In order to use the program you have to add the following toolboxes (open matlab and click on Add-Ons):

Signal processing toolbox

DSP system toolbox

Communication toolbox

Registration and installation are very fast, so anyone can test the program in a short time.

Files description:

f_Statistics_Set_Shaping_Theory_Huffman_l.m

Matlab program that performs the data compression experiment.

fSSTt.p

Function that performs the transform

invfSSTt

Function that performs the inverse transform. Furthermore, if the transmitted file is modified by the noise, it can detect the error with a probability 1/(N+1), with N length of the sequence. When the error is detected, appear the message "error found".

In order to understand what the transform does, we suggest to read the following presentation:
